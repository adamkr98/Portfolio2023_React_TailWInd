                Having studied Web Design, I am
                curently in process of expanding my
                knowledge in Web Development at
                BeCode.
                After creating some projects with
                HTML/CSS/JS I find myself passionate
                about the front-end side and would
                like to expand my skills during an
                internship. Let's connect!
